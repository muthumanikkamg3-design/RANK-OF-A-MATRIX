# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
###Step 1: Write the matrix

Write the given matrix in its original form.

###Step 2: Apply elementary row operations

Use row operations (swap rows, multiply a row by a non-zero number, add/subtract rows) to convert the matrix into row echelon form.


###Step 3: Identify non-zero rows

After simplification, observe the rows that are not completely zero.

###Step 4: Determine the rank

The number of non-zero rows is the rank of the matrix.

### Step5 : Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
